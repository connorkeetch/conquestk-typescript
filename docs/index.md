# 📚 ConquestK Documentation

_Public-source status reviewed: November 11, 2026_

> **Maintenance status — November 11, 2026:** This is an inactive personal project, shared for reference and experimentation. No ongoing feature work, releases, or support response times are planned. Issues and pull requests may go unanswered.

This directory preserves historical guides and design notes for **conquestk-typescript**. Start with the [current README](../README.md) for the correct runtime, repository/branch, local setup, required services, known gaps, licensing status, and support expectations. Old launch dates, “active” roadmaps, production/staging URLs, and environment examples do not describe an available deployment of this snapshot. Source code and package manifests take precedence when older guides disagree.

Operational scripts are for databases and services you control. A fresh install does not need access to the original infrastructure.
